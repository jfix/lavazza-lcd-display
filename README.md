You know you want to watch it! https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oce7Vgq1DH8

A tiny web app that gets started when the Raspberry Pi boots up to display basic information about our coffee consumption. Is related to the dash-button project that adds coffee consumptions to the database.

LCD display resolution is 480x320.

Uses Express, MongoDB, Pug.

A very first _tiny webapp_ following the advice given here: http://andrewhfarmer.com/tiny-unique-app/
